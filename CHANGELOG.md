## [1.0.0] - 2024-09-14

### Added

#### Core Infrastructure
- **IAuthorizationContext Interface**: Foundational contract for authorization context
  - `UserId` property for user identification
  - `TenantId` property for multi-tenant context
  - `Scopes` property exposing available permission scopes
  - `HasScope(string scope)` method for permission checking

#### Package Configuration
- Complete NuGet package setup with proper metadata
- MIT license configuration
- GitHub Packages publishing integration
- Comprehensive package documentation

#### Development Infrastructure
- Full .NET 8 project structure with modern C# features
- xUnit test framework integration with FluentAssertions and Moq
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and publishing
- Standard .NET project configuration (Directory.Build.props, .gitignore)
- Comprehensive README with usage examples and architecture guidance

#### Documentation
- Complete API documentation with XML comments
- Architecture integration diagrams
- Multi-tenant usage patterns and examples
- 3-layer scope system design documentation

### Design Decisions

#### Scope-Based Authorization
- Implemented hierarchical scope system (Platform > Service > Resource)
- Example scope patterns: `platform.admin`, `accounting.invoices.read`
- Future support for resource-specific scopes: `accounting.invoices.{id}.read`

#### Multi-Tenant Architecture
- Built-in tenant context isolation
- User and tenant relationship management
- Tenant-aware authorization decisions

#### Integration Strategy
- Designed for ASP.NET Core and gRPC service integration
- Dependency injection ready interface design
- Minimal dependencies for maximum compatibility

### Technical Details

#### Dependencies
- Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.Abstractions (8.0.0)
- Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions (8.0.0)
- Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Abstractions (2.2.0)

#### Test Coverage
- Interface contract validation tests
- Property and method signature verification
- Foundation for future implementation testing

### Next Steps

This foundational release enables:
- Issue #2: Implement IAuthorizationContext concrete implementation
- Issue #3: Create 3-layer scope system validation
- Issue #4: Context header resolution middleware
- Issue #5: Authorization middleware integration
- Issue #6: Comprehensive unit test suite
